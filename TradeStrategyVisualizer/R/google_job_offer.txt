one area that i can contribute is to help grow google analytics market share in the country/region. as for my background, over the past 7 years at yahoo, i work as a core engineer of the data and analytics group. prior to that, i work for the business intelligence group for 3 years at national semiconductor, and prior to national, another 3 years stint with a startup company. i have designed and built an in-house web analytics system, similar to google analytics, as well as implementing and supporting yahoo web analytics for our largest customers (advertisers and publishers).
